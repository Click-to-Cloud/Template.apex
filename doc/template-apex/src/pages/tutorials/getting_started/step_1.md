## {$page.title}

Template.apex has a dependency on [R.apex](https://github.com/Click-to-Cloud/R.apex) and [Script.apex](https://github.com/Click-to-Cloud/Script.apex).

Include these first.

Then, we will include Template.apex.

Include **Template.cls**, and **TemplateTest.cls**(optional) into your Org, and you are ready to go.

If you want to use Func Package, please include **TemplatePackage.cls**. You can check more on [R.apex](https://github.com/Click-to-Cloud/R.apex).
